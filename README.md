# Homer's Last Theorem
This project hopes to find Homer's Last Theorem, based on the subtle joke from the Simpson's. Brought to light by Simon Singh
in his book: The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets.

<br>

This particular secret involves <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem'>Fermat's Last Theorem </a>. 
A mathematical problem that has plagued mathematicians for over 300 years.

Fermat's Last Theorem states: <br>

a<sup>n</sup> + b<sup>n</sup> = c<sup>n</sup> <br>
for n > 2, and a, b, c > 0 and a, b, c, n âˆˆ Z

But Homer has appeared to have found a solution: <br>

<br>

And putting it in on the calculator seems to work! How is it that Homer Simpson, or more accurately the writer, David S. Cohen seemed to <br>
find a solution to the problem that took mathimaticians centuries to solve? <br>
